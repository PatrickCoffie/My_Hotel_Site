## Note to Lecturer
I completed this project **individually** because I reached out to the class representative to be added to a group but unfortunately, I was not included.  
Since I worked alone, it took me extra time, and I sincerely apologize if this submission comes after the deadline.  
I kindly ask for your **pardon and understanding**.
